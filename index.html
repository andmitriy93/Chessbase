                    ><strong>Magnus Carlsen</strong> in full Sven Magnus Øen
                    Carlsen, (born November 30, 1990, Tønsberg, Norway),
                    Norwegian chess player who in 2013, at age 22, became the
                    second youngest world chess champion.Carlsen’s father first
                    taught him how to play chess when he was five years old. He
                    played in his first tournament at the age of eight. Carlsen
                    finished second in the boys’ under-12 division at the 2002
                    Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) World Youth
                    Chess Championship, held in Iráklion, Greece. In January
                    2004 he won his first tournament, at Wijk aan Zee,
                    Netherlands. Although he was playing in the lowest-rated
                    group against adult players, his domination of the
                    tournament, best exemplified in a game won with a 29-move
                    checkmate, established him as a player with enormous
                    potential and led American chess player Lubomir Kavalek to
                    dub him the “Mozart of chess.” In March of the same year, at
                    a blitz chess tournament (where the game is played at a much
                    faster pace than normal) in Reykjavík, he defeated former
                    world champion Anatoly Karpov and drew a game against
                    another former champion, Garry Kasparov. He became a
                    grandmaster after finishing in second place at the Dubai
                    Open Chess Championship in April 2004.</span

                    >Carlsen came in 10th at the 2005 World Chess Cup in
                    Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, thus becoming the youngest player
                    to earn a place at the Candidate Matches in Elista, Russia,
                    in 2007, where the top four players received a spot at the
                    FIDE World Chess Championship later that year in Mexico
                    City. However, he was defeated in the first round by
                    Armenian chess player Levon Aronian (who went on to place
                    seventh at the world championship).Carlsen’s victory at the
                    Pearl Spring Chess Tournament in Nanjing, China, in October
                    2009 with 8 out of a possible 10 points was considered one
                    of the all-time best tournament performances. In November he
                    won the World Blitz Championship in Moscow. In January 2010
                    FIDE announced that Carlsen was the top player in the world.
                    He had recently turned 19 and was thus the youngest player
                    to become number one. That year he was hired by the Dutch
                    clothing company G-Star to model its denim clothing in an
                    advertising campaign. Carlsen surprised the chess world in
                    November 2010, when he decided to forgo the 2011 Candidate
                    Matches to select a challenger to play against Indian chess
                    player Viswanathan Anand for the world championship, arguing
                    that the championship structure was flawed and that the
                    reigning champion should not receive an automatic spot in
                    the final round.</span

                    grandmaster who is currently the World Chess Champion, World
                    Rapid Chess Champion, and World Blitz Chess Champion.Carlsen
                    is the number one chess player who earned the grandmaster
                    title at the age of 13. By the age of 28, he had won the
                    World Chess Championship ten times, Blitz World Championship
                    four times, and Rapid World Championship twice. As a young
                    child, he showed heightened intellectual capacities, so his
                    father taught him chess as a sport. At first, he did not
                    give much concern to it, but later, he started practicing
                    chess to win against his eldest sister. That eventually led
                    him to be a champion and win uncountable competitions in the
                    future. Not just a champion, Carlsen has broken many records
                    as well. He was the youngest chess grandmaster at the age of
                    13 years and four months; he broke the unbreakable FIDE
                    rating of Garry Kasparov; won his first championship against
                    Viswanathan Anand; won the World Chess Championship tenth
                    times; received the top FIDE rating in the year 2011, then
                    in 2016 to name a few.

                    1942) was a Cuban chess player who was world chess champion
                    from 1921 to 1927. A chess prodigy, he is widely renowned
                    for his exceptional endgame skill and speed of play. The son
                    of two Spaniards, Capablanca was born in 1888 in Havana. He
                    beat Cuban champion Juan Corzo in a match on 17 November
                    1901, two days before his 13th birthday.[1][2] His victory
                    over Frank Marshall in a 1909 match earned him an invitation
                    to the 1911 San Sebastian tournament, which he won ahead of
                    players such as Akiba Rubinstein, Aron Nimzowitsch and
                    Siegbert Tarrasch. Over the next several years, Capablanca
                    had a strong series of tournament results. After several
                    unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match with then world
                    champion Emanuel Lasker, Capablanca finally won the world
                    chess champion title from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was
                    undefeated from 10 February 1916 to 21 March 1924, a period
                    that included the world championship match with
                    Lasker.</span

                    >Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik, (born August 17 [August 4,
                    Old Style], 1911, Kuokkala, Finland [now Repino,
                    Russia]—died May 5, 1995, Moscow, Russia), Soviet chess
                    master who held the world championship three times (1948–57,
                    1958–60, and 1961–63).At the age of 14, less than two years
                    after he had learned the moves of chess, Botvinnik defeated
                    the then-current world champion, José Raúl Capablanca, in
                    one game of an exhibition in which Capablanca played
                    simultaneously against several opponents. In 1931 Botvinnik
                    won the chess championship of the Soviet Union for the first
                    of seven times. Botvinnik’s style of play was eclectic,
                    methodical, and rational rather than strongly
                    intuitive.</span

                    Louisiana, U.S.—died July 10, 1884, New Orleans), American
                    chess master who, during his public career of less than two
                    years, became the world’s leading player. Acclaimed by some
                    as the most brilliant player of all time, he was first to
                    rely on the now-established principle of development before
                    attack.Morphy learned chess at the age of 10. At 19 he was
                    admitted to the Louisiana bar on condition that he not
                    practice law until coming of age. After winning the first
                    American chess championship tournament at New York City in
                    1857, he traveled to Europe, where he defeated Adolf
                    Anderssen of Germany, the unofficial world champion, and
                    every other master who would face him—the leading English
                    player, Howard Staunton, avoided a match with him. In Paris
                    Morphy played blindfolded against eight strong players,
                    winning six games and drawing two. He returned to the United
                    States in 1859 and issued a challenge, offering to face any
                    player in the world at odds of pawn and move . When there
                    was no response, Morphy abandoned his public chess
                    career.</span

                    ><strong>Mikhail Nekhemyevich Tal</strong>, (born November
                    9, 1936, Riga, Latvia—died June 28, 1992, Moscow, Russia),
                    Latvian chess grandmaster who in 1960, at the age of 23,
                    became the youngest world chess champion when he upset the
                    defending champion, Mikhail Botvinnik, by a score of 121/2
                    to 81/2.Tal, who learned to play chess at the age of six,
                    was known for his complex and audacious moves. He became a
                    national master and Latvian champion in 1953, at age 16. In
                    1957, the year he graduated from Riga University, he became
                    an international grandmaster and won the first of his six
                    titles as champion of the U.S.S.R. He established his right
                    to challenge Botvinnik with impressive victories in the 1958
                    interzonal and 1959 candidates’ tournaments, both held in
                    Yugoslavia. He became seriously ill with kidney disease
                    shortly before he lost to Botvinnik in a 1961 rematch.
                    Despite continuing bouts with liver and kidney ailments, he
                    won five more Soviet titles (1958, 1967, 1972, 1974, and
                    1978) and numerous international competitions, notably the
                    high-speed world blitz championship in Canada in 1988. Tal
                    was one of the best and wittiest writers of the world
                    champions. Two of his books, translated as Life and Games of
                    Mikhail Tal (1976) and Tal-Botvinnik 1960 Match for the
                    World Championship (1970), are treasures of chess

                    Alekhin or Aljechin, original name Aleksandr Aleksandrovich
                    Alyokhin, (born October 31, 1892, Moscow, Russian
                    Empire—died March 24, 1946, Estoril, Portugal), world
                    champion chess player from 1927 to 1935 and from 1937 until
                    his death, noted for using a great variety of
                    attacks.Alekhine was a precocious chess player, becoming a
                    master at age 16 and a grandmaster at age 22. He was playing
                    in a tournament in Mannheim, Germany, when World War I broke
                    out; after being released from internment, he served in the
                    Red Cross division of the Russian army. After the Russian
                    Revolution of 1917, Alekhine became a naturalized French
                    citizen and studied law at the University of Paris. In 1927,
                    after a contest lasting nearly three months, he won the
                    world chess championship from José Raúl Capablanca of Cuba.
                    Eight years later he lost the title to Max Euwe of the
                    Netherlands, but he regained it from Euwe in 1937. Alekhine
                    broke the world blindfold chess record in 1924, 1925, and
                    1933. He also wrote extensively on the game of chess. He is
                    best known for his game collections My Best Games of Chess
                    1908–1923 (1927) and My Best Games of Chess 1924–1937
                    (1939), which are regarded as classics.</span

                    sense of the word, Hikaru swiftly knocked down nearly every
                    age record on his way into the elite ranks. He was, at one
                    time, the youngest American Master in history (10 years),
                    the youngest American International Master (13), and
                    eventually broke Bobby fischer’s record by three months when
                    he became the youngest American Grandmaster at the time (15
                    years). ‘Naka’, as his fans affectionately refer to him, has
                    collected numerous titles and championships since the age of
                    13, when he arrived on the national scene by winning the
                    2001 U.S Junior Championship. He quickly confirmed his place
                    among the elites, shocking the world with a sweet 16
                    appearance in the 2004 FIDE World Cup. This recipient of the
                    prestigious Samford Chess Fellowship, Nakamura won the 2007
                    National Open, the North American Open three times, and was
                    gold medalist on the first board of the 2010 World Team
                    Championship. Since the advent of published FIDE Blitz
                    ratings, Nakamura has graced the top of the list,
                    demonstrating inimitable acuity and speed. In 2015, the
                    American GM won the Gibraltar Chess Masters tournament,
                    captured his fourth U.S. Championship, place first at the
                    Millionaire Chess Open, and propelled his classical FIDE
                    rating to a career high of 2814. 2016 also proved to be a
                    fruitful year for Naka as he repeated first place finishes
                    at the Gibraltar Chess Festival and the Zurich Chess
                    Challenge. In 2017, Hikaru won his third consecutive
                    Gibraltar Chess Festival. Most recently, he was the 2018
                    Grand Chess Tour winner.</span

                    father at the age of six, and began competing in junior
                    tournaments at the age of nine. When he earned his
                    Grandmaster title at the age of fourteen, So completed the
                    ‘trifecta’ of being the youngest-ever Filipino National
                    Champion, IM, and GM. Wesley came to the U.S. in August of
                    2012, enrolled at Webster University, and leapt from being a
                    top 100 player to becoming one of the top ten in the world.
                    He led Webster to three back to back national championships.
                    In 2014, So won the Millionaire Chess Open. Beginning with
                    his win in the 2016 Grand Chess Tour, that he sealed by
                    winning the 2016 Sinquefield Cup, So entered two of his most
                    successful years yet. He won two gold medals at the 2016
                    Baku Olympiad, one for himself on board three, and one with
                    the entire team. He passed the FIDE rating of 2800 by
                    winning the 2017 Tata Steel Masters tournament, and then
                    became the 2017 U.S. Champion beating Alexander Onischuk in
                    a playoff match. Just last year, Wesley became the first
                    official Fischer Random World Champion after defeating
                    Magnus Carlsen with an astounding 13.5-2.5 score.</span
